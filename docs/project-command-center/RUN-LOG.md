# Run log

## 2026-10-12 — GitHub issue #2 local visual QA

- Branch: `admin-hub-overhaul`. No merge, deploy, SQL, or staff-role changes.
- Sora mutated NO · Twinkle mutated NO · PlayTester nonstaff.
- Production APP `20261008-rc133` unchanged. Smoke paused.
- A1 visual acceptance remains **open**.

### Rendered findings (fixture REAL DOM)

| Finding | Action |
|---|---|
| Previous/Next shown while both disabled | Hidden unless `showPager` |
| “Showing 1–2 of 2. Server page size is 50.” on a single page | Status is now `2 trainers.` |
| Username repeated login (`fixtureoak`) | Username omitted when it equals login |
| Available catalog repeated Cosmetics pills | Catalog collapses to a one-line match note |
| Empty/denied/loading hard to reach | Fixture QA buttons; no live `playCall` |
| Unlocked vs locked | Kept as text + `data-state`; titles/badges already distinguished |

### Interaction checks (LOCAL HARNESS / REAL DOM)

Directory, Find, row select, Overview / Progression / empty results, Back (via empty reset), 390px `is-profile` hides directory. Keyboard: search form, trainer buttons, pane tabs, Back remain native controls.

Stale-response cancellation remains generation tokens in `js/admin-next.js` (STATIC). Not re-proven with live RPCs.

### Screenshots

Browser-tool webfont capture is garbled. Accessibility tree is the text source of truth.
